#Connect4AI: A Machine Learning-Powered Connect 4 Bot

##Overview

Connect4AI is a full-stack project that trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Transformer model to play Connect 4. The dataset is generated using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and the AI is deployed on AWS using Docker. A web interface built with Anvil allows users to play against the AI.
