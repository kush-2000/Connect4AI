# Connect4AI
Connect4AI is a full-stack project that trains a CNN and Transformer to play Connect 4 using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for data generation. The AI is hosted on AWS with a Dockerized backend and an Anvil-based web app for interactive gameplay. The project benchmarks model performance and explores deep learning for board game strategy.
